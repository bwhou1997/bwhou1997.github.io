abstract: The interactions between electrons and phonons play the key role in determining the carrier transport properties in semiconductors. In this work, comprehensive investigations on full electron–phonon (el–ph) couplings and their influences on carrier mobility and thermoelectric (TE) performances of 2D group IV and V elemental monolayers are performed, and we also analyze the selection rules on el–ph couplings using group theory.
