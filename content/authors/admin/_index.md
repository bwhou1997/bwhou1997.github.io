Hi! My name is Bowen Hou (侯博文). I am a third year PhD candidate at Yale , where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Diana Qiu](https://qiugroup.yale.edu/). Before this, I studied at Fudan University and graduated with the highest honor for undergraduate students ([Fudan Graduation Star](https://optics.fudan.edu.cn/2e/14/c39848a470548/page.htm))

I work in theoretical and computational condensed matter physics. My research includes first-principle computational methodology development and high performance computing (HPC).

More specifically: 
- Designed and implemented a novel deep learning and generative model, Crystal Variational Autoencoders (Crystal-VAEs), to study electronic structures and predict computationally expensive many-body effects.

- Develop and apply the first-principle algorithm to investigate the complex many-body interaction in materials. Currently focus on the exciton-phonon coupling and non-equilibrium exciton dynamics in low-dimensional materials. This algorithm, optimized for HPC platforms, achieved a 500x reduction in computation time.
