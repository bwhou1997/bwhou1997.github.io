title: Unsupervised Learning of Individual Kohn-Sham States
summary: In this work, we showcase for the first time that a well-crafted VAE is capable of representing KS-DFT wavefunctions on a manifold within a significantly compressed latent space, which is 10 3 10 4 times smaller than the original input. Importantly, these succinct representations still retain the full physical information inherent in the initial data.
