title: Data-driven Low-rank Approximation for Electron-hole Vertex Function
summary:  Utilizing the localized excitonic effects in the Hilbert space of crystalline systems, we achieve at least 95% compression of the kernel and an order-of-magnitude speedup of TD-aGW calculations. Our method, rooted in physical interpretability, outperforms existing machine learning approaches by avoiding intensive training processes and eliminating time-accumulated errors, providing a general framework for high-throughput, nonequilibrium simulation of light-driven dynamics in materials.
