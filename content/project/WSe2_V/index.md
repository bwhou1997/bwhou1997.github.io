title: Spin-Stabilization by Coulomb Blockade in a Vanadium Dimer in WSe2
summary: In this study, we examine vanadium-doped WSe2 monolayers on quasi-freestanding epitaxial graphene, by high-resolution scanning probe microscopy and ab initio calculations. Our findings provide microscopic insights into the charge stabilization and many-body effects of single dopants and dopant pairs in a TMD host material.
